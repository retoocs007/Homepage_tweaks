Cusom CSS and other stuff for Homepage (https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)

<img src="/demo.webp" alt="Demo" width="800">


Edit your `custom.css` with parts that you need.

CSS includes:
 - Background color to tint Safari Tab Bar on iPadOS (Show Color in Tab Bar)
 - Animated starfield overlay (best with darker background)
 - Other tweaks to clean up and use more avaliable space on iPad and PC browsers

`stars_with_fog.css` have fog animation. It's sluggish on iPad 10th gen running iPadOS 26 dev beta 5.
If you want to try it yourself copy code from `stars_with_fog.css` and replace lines form 5 to 73 in `custom.css`.
